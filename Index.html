<h1>My Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto"</h1>
<p>On the coder/cartographer/critique spectrum I would place myself closer to the cartographer position. Despite the fact that in order to remain competitive and keep up in the industry it is essential to lean towards the position of the coder, I am not inherently one to just accept a new technology as being superior or being given and workflow to follow and running with it. Even while learning the basics of cartography I have asked deeper question as to what the computer is actually doing when I run a simple process and that is something I feel that is being lost through the increasing intuitiveness of a user interface in a Geographic Information System. As I move forward in my mapping career I aim to make myself more efficient in the work that I do, i.e. automating data production and analysis and then, without compromising my inquisitive nature, make the information I produce publicly available and intuitive for the non-mapping community. In relation to the six manifesto points, I believe that the digital world’s reflection of the material world is such a rich resource to draw upon as it is noted that, “The two are fundamentally interconnected, in ways more serious and substantive than what kind of food or drink one tweets about.” The data produced isn’t necessarily distorted rather more telling and informative of other related factors such as a locations lack of technological advancement. A recent example of this in real time is how social media posts were tracked throughout the state of New Jersey in the wake of Superstorm Sandy as an indication of power outages.
